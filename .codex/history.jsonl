This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\n\nFollow this execution flow:\n\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\n     * MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\n     * MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\n     * PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\n\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\n   - Version change: old → new\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\n   - Added sections\n   - Removed sections\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\n\n6. Validation before final output:\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\n   - Version line matches report.\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\n\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\n\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\n   - New version and bump rationale.\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\n\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\n\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\n\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\n\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\n"}
